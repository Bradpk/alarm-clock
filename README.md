### Alarm Clock 

This project emulates a typical alarm clock. Users can set the time they want the alarm to go off. When the set time matches the current time, an audible alarm will play the grandfather clock melody using the Tone.js JavaScript library, and an alert will pop up on the page. Additionally, there is a "magic button" that plays another known melody, which I added while experimenting with Tone.js.
